Here's how to setup mysite.

Source the DSS python environment: source ~/dev/python-env/dss-env/activate/bin

cd ~/dev/

Follow the python tutorial long enought to set up the mysite django project and polls app, w/ functioning model layer.

Then setup the resoruces and httpadapters, urls just enough so that we can use the polls/ urls to get json.
Make sure you have mysite/urls.py include mysite/polls/urls.py, where all our urls go.  This gets the app namespace correctly.

Then start setting up the extjs like it is in pht:
   * root url needs to render root.html
   * then copy basic dir structure at static/js/lib and static/js/pht
   * make sure settings.py is setup propperly to find all static files in polls app.


google 'Extjs geting started' and follow that.  Once you get the hellow world polls.js working, follow the 
MVC Architecture tutorial.

But then when you get to the models, jsut copy what the pht does.
